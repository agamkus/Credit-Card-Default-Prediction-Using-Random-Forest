# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction-Using-Random-Forest
Credit default is one of the most important problems in the banking and risk analytics industry. There are various attributes which can be used to predict default:
- Age
- Income
- Employment status
- Past loans
- Payment
- Number of times a credit payment has been delayed by the customer etc.

We have to analyze the provided data and we will build a random forest model to predict whether a given customer defaults or not. We'll start the process with data cleaning and preparation and then tune the model to find optimal hyperparameters.
